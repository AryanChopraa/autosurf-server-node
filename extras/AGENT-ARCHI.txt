AI Browser Agent Architecture
1. Core Components
Puppeteer:

Handles browser automation (navigation, clicking, scrolling, typing, etc.).

Captures screenshots of the webpage for analysis.

Executes DOM manipulations (e.g., highlighting links).

OpenAI GPT-4:

Acts as the "brain" of the agent, deciding which actions to take based on the task and the current state of the webpage.

Uses the SYSTEM_PROMPT to understand its role and the tools available to it.

Tools:

A set of predefined functions (handle_url, handle_search, handle_click, handle_scroll, handle_typing) that the agent can call to interact with the webpage.

Highlight Script:

A utility (highlightLinks) that identifies and highlights clickable elements on the webpage by adding custom attributes (gpt-link-text, gpt-alt-text).

Task Execution Loop:

The agent continuously interacts with the webpage and OpenAI in a loop until the task is completed.

2. Workflow
Initialization:

The agent launches a Puppeteer browser instance and sets up a new page.

Task Execution:

The user provides a task (e.g., "Find the latest news on AI").

The agent sends the task and the current state of the webpage (via a screenshot) to OpenAI.

OpenAI responds with a tool call (e.g., handle_search or handle_click).

Action Execution:

The agent executes the tool call using Puppeteer (e.g., navigating to a URL, clicking a link, or scrolling the page).

After executing the action, the agent captures a new screenshot and sends it back to OpenAI for further instructions.

Completion:

The loop continues until OpenAI determines that the task is complete and provides a final response.

3. Enhanced Features
Robust Error Handling:

Retries failed actions up to 3 times.

Provides detailed error messages for debugging.

Dynamic Content Support:

Waits for dynamic content to load before interacting with elements.

Human-Like Interactions:

Simulates human behavior with delays (e.g., hovering before clicking, waiting after typing).

Advanced Element Identification:

Identifies all interactive elements, including text-based, image-based, and dynamically loaded elements.

Optimized Screenshot Capture:

Captures only the visible portion of the page for faster processing.
